# Hall-Automation-Project
This repository consists of the code and hardware details of my DIY embedded system Project. I used Atmega16 Microcontroller to build a visitor counter, which senses entry and exit of a person using IR Sensors and displays the count on interfaced LCD. When the room is empty it automatically turns off the lights. I used AVR Studio for coding.
